# Stonks

Stonks is a stock monitoring tool that is used inside your Terminal. Right now it uses the API's provided by "[tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/streaming)".


## Goal of Project

This is a simple project I am building for fun. When starting, this will start a new TUI - using bubble tea library - and allow you to search and display different stocks and option pricing as well as additional details about those stocks and/or options.
